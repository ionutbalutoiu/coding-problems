# Task

Write a function:

```java
class Solution { public void solution(int N); }
```

that prints out ASCII-art in the shape of the capital letter `L`, made up of copies of the capital letter `L`. Parameter N is an integer (between 1 and 100) and represents the expected size of the ASCII-art (the output should comprise N rows, the last of which should comprise N letters `L`).

For example, here is the output of N = 4:

```shell
L
L
L
LLLL
```

The function should not return any value.

You can print a string to the output (without or with the end-of-line character) as follows:

```java
System.out.print("sample string");
System.out.println("while line");
```
