# Task

Given a string, write a program to examine whether the pairs and the orders of `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]` are correct in the given expression.

Example:

```shell
Input: "[()]{}{[()()]()}"
Output: Input is valid
Explanation: all the brackets are well-formed

Input: "[(])"
Output: Input is NOT valid
Explanation: 1 and 4 brackets are not balanced because 
there is a closing ']' before the closing '('
```
