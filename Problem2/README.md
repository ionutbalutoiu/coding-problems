# Task

Write a function `solution` that, given an integer N, returns a string of length N containing as many different lower-case letters ('a'-'z') as possible, in which each letter occurs an equal number of times.

Examples:

1. Given N = 3, the function may return "fig", "pea", "nut", etc. Each of these strings contains three different letters with the same number of occurrences.

2. Given N = 5, the function may return "mango", "grape", "melon", etc.

3. Given N = 30, the function may return "aabbcc..oo" (each letter from 'a' to 'o' occurs twice). The string contains 15 different letters.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* N is an integer within the range [1..200,000].
